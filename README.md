FileMaker Vim
=============

Intro
-----

The FileMaker Vim plugin provides syntax highlighting for FileMaker calculations to be edited in Vim. It detects the filetype for the extensions .filemaker, fmcalc and .fm and also recognizes FileMaker calcs that have been opened using the [QuickCursor](https://github.com/jessegrosjean/quickcursor) app on OS X. (Note that QuickCursor is no longer being supported, but still appears to work with OS X Yosemite).

Installation
------------

FileMaker Vim is compatible with [Pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332), so the easiest way to install it is to simply place the `filemakercalc` folder into `~/.vim/bundle`.
