1. Description

filemaker.com provides syntax highlighting and snippet support for FileMaker
calculations to be edited in Vim. It detects the filetype for the extentions
filemaker, fmcalc, fm and fmfn. It also recognizes FileMaker calcs that have
been opened using the QuickCursor app on OS X (|FileMakerVim-quickcursor|).

																*FileMakerVim-requirements* *FMV-requirements*
1.1 Requirements

Currently there are two main feature sets including with filemaker.vim: syntax
highlighting and snippets. Syntax highlight only requires a copy of Vim and
installing the filemaker.vim plugin.

At this point filemaker.vim has been tested with MacVim snapshot 74 which runs
Vim 7.4 and command-line Vim 7.4 running within a terminal on Mac OS X. It
will probably work with Vim 7 or above on any platform suppored, but no
testing of this has been performed.

																			*FileMakerVim-ultisnips* *FMV-ultisnips*
1.1.1 Ultisnips

UltiSnips is a snippet system inspired by the snippets feature from TextMate.
Using the snippets feature requires UltiSnips, which you can get for free from
https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips. See the installation instructions below
for additional details.

																	*FileMakerVim-quickcursor* *FMV-quickcursor*
1.1.2 QuickCursor

QuickCursor is in no way required for using filemaker.vim, but if you're using
a Mac and you have a version of it, it can make life much easier by allowing
you to press a key combination and open a FileMaker calculation directly in
MacVim.

Unfortunately QuickCursor is no longer being actively sold because of
incompatibility with Apple's sandboxing. If you were fortunate enough to get
version 2 before it was removed from the Mac App Store, you're good to go. The
publisher of QuickCursor has made the source code available at
https://github.com/jessegrosjean/quickcursor, but all attempts to build and
run it under OS X Yosemite have failed to demonstrate that it works
successfully.

In the future we hope to make either version 1 available for a free download
or edit the source code of version 2 and make it available. In the meantime,
if you're interested in a workaround, check out what some others have done by
replacing QuickCursor with custom-built routines built with Keyboard Maestro
(http://www.keyboardmaestro.com,
http://rocketink.net/2013/05/quickcursor-keyboard-maestro.html).

2. Installation and Updating

Since it's far more likely that anyone interested in filemaker.vim knows
FileMaker and not Vim rather than the other way around, these instructions
will provide assume only that you have some version of Vim for your platform
and git. Getting filemaker.vim working with Vim on your machine is possible
without git, but such a procedure is not yet covered here.

You can get MacVim at https://code.google.com/p/macvim/ and gvim for Windows
at ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc/gvim74.exe.

																						*FileMakerVim-vundle* *FMV-vundle*
2.3 Vundle

Vundle is the recommended method for installing filemaker.vim. You can find
complete installation instructions for Vundle at
https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim. Here's the quick version:

	1. Create a .vim directory in your home directory.
	2. Create a bundle directory in the .vim directory.
	3. Run the following command from your terminal application:>

	git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

	4. Create a .vimrc file in your home directory and add the following lines
	to it>

	set runtimepath+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
	call vundle#begin()
	Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'
	call vundle#end()
	filetype plugin indent on
	
	5. Quick Vim if it's already running and relaunch it.

											*FileMakerVim-ultisnips-install* *FMV-ultisnips-install*
2.4 UltiSnips

Now that Vundle is installed, installing UltiSnips is very easy. In your
.vimrc file, after the first call to Plugin, add the following lines:>

  Plugin 'SirVer/ultisnips'
  Plugin 'honza/vim-snippets'

The second one is completely optional, but will add many useful snippets for
other languages (C, PHP, JavaScript, etc.) as well as snippets for writing
snippets. See the UltiSnips documentation for more information.

Once you've added the above two lines to .vimrc, run the following command in
Vim:>

	:PluginInstall

																					*FileMakerVim-install* *FMV-insall*
2.5 filemaker.vim

Installing filemaker.vim is just like installing UltiSnips. Add this line to
.vimrc after your previous lines of calls to Plugin and before the call to
vundle#end():>

	Plugin 'chivalry/filemaker.vim'

Then again run the following command in Vim:>

	:PluginInstall
